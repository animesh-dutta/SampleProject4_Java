Poor Customer Service: Customer service can be a significant issue with online banking. 
Representatives are often unavailable 24/7, and the response time can be slow. 
If you need help with a time-sensitive issue, this can be a substantial issue.
Security Risks: Despite the safety measures, online banking can be susceptible to security breaches.
Hackers may gain access to sensitive information, such as account numbers, passwords, and financial data. 
The loss of such information can lead to identity theft and fraud.
System Malfunctions: Technical problems can cause online banking systems to become unreliable or inaccessible.
It can make it difficult for customers to manage their finances and make payments.
Limited Advisory Services: Online banking does not offer the same range of advisory services that a traditional bank can provide.
For example, many banks offer investment advice, loan products, and financial planning services.
Lack of Human Interaction: Online banking can lack the human interaction that many customers prefer.
It can make it difficult to get answers to complex questions or provide detailed information about a particular service.
Internet Requirement: To carry out banking transactions online, you must have a stable internet connection. Lack of a proper internet connection leads to failure or duplication of transactions.
Computer Access: Only some have access to a computer. It can make online banking difficult for those who donâ€™t have access.
