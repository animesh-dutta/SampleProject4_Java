The chance of human error has been reduced with internet banking. 
As we know that the role of humans in the whole transaction process has been noticeably reduced.

A fully automated internet banking system operates using digitally recorded and stored transactions.
Each and every record in the books of accounts do not need to be manually maintained.
So there is minimal chance of human error.
